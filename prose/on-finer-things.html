        <p>i am not an alcoholic, nor tobacco addict.<br>
          i believe, however, in the human ability to choose one's own existence.<br>
          savoring a sip of wine or neat whiskey,<br>
          then a different one,<br>
          and again, over time,<br>
          is simply allowing yourself to experience<br>
          all that life has to offer.<br>
          when i am of an age where my life has been sufficiently lived,<br>
          then will i smoke pipe and cigars.<br>
          one need not become intoxicated nor sick,<br>
          but to end this existence without knowledge of the subtleties of<br>
          taste<br>
          smell<br>
          physical feeling<br>
          mental experience<br>
          of those items which have been created<br>
          seemingly for the sole purpose of<br>
          ingestion by homo sapiens<br>
          stands contradictory (in my eyes)<br>
          to the idea of experiencing<br>
          the gift of existence<br>
          in the first place.<br>
          when one is in a place of acceptance and enjoyment,<br>
          and when one is not susceptible to addiction,<br>
          to intentionally avoid an experience life offers<br>
          is to deprive oneself of a gift<br>
          and is akin to taking life for granted.<br>
          so, when i am older, and nearing death,<br>
          i will drink,<br>
          and when i am older, and nearing death,<br>
          i will smoke<br>
          cigars and pipes, plain tobacco,<br>
          living slowly and richly,<br>
          taking all in.<br>
          for now, however, i avoid a slow suicide.</p>
        
        <p>i read, but am not well-read (yet).<br>
          i make sure to read the "classics" though<br>
          because why should i not?<br>
          they are "classic" for a reason.<br>
          they tell of a time when people were uninhibited by late capitalism,<br>
          when <a href="trails-of-time.html">life moved slowly</a> and locally,<br>
          when to produce was to be known to produce,<br>
          when what mattered was truly tangible.<br>
          what matters in the post-information age is still tangible,<br>
          though an ephemeral cloak of<br>
          post-contemporary noise<br>
          hangs over all,<br>
          obscuring meaning to the clueless and<br>
          troubling the clued-in.<br>
          that is not to say<br>
          there are no good producers in<br>
          the post-information age<br>
          and it is not to say that<br>
          mediocre producers should quit producing.<br>
          i am a producer, after all,<br>
          and i know who my influences are.</p>
        
        <p>i have not built anything notable with my hands,<br>
          nor written a magnum opus.<br>
          i will build some manner of<br>
          tangible structure<br>
          to last forever<br>
          (or at least as long as i can<br>
          control its environment).<br>
          i will reform land and mold my world.<br>
          one should be long-remembered;<br>
          stone and metal and<br>
          large swathes of earth are nigh-immutable.<br>
          i will create many a composition,<br>
          whether musical or oratorical or scribed,<br>
          and they will be treasured by people<br>
          i will never have the chance to meet.</p>
        
        <p>to mark memory is to achieve immortality.</p>
