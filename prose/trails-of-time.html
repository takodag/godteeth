      <figure>
        <p>red sand underfoot<br>
          a winter sun drops, sits on the horizon<br>
          evening sky shifts pink, then gray<br>
          and the birds slow their song<br>
          it is quiet in the empty<br>
          we didn't mean for it to take us so long</p>
        
        <p>guiding lights in the distance<br>
          a bit farther than we thought we had walked<br>
          getting cold in the dark<br>
          seeing faces and the people in the park<br>
          but the people don't have faces at all</p>
        
        <p>and the time just slips by<br>
          we meet others just beginning their trek<br>
          but the mountain is too high<br>
          if they leave now will they even come back?<br>
          are they <a href="../misc/edc.html">prepared</a> for the journey?<br>
          are they prepared for the long walk home?<br>
          are they prepared to see real life?<br>
          i'd like to say but i don't know</p>
