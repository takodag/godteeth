        <p>the internet is "run" by, like, 10 major websites, and society doesn't seem to care. you should. they're selling your data to the highest bidder (usually your own government) and it's being used to both track and brainwash you.</p>
        
        <p>how do we regain privacy?</p>

        <ul class="squareBullets">
          <li><a href="build-your-own-website.html">build your own website,</a> it's not hard</li>
          <li>de-google as much as possible</li>
          <li>use federated social networking, if any</li>
          <li>make web payments via <a href="monero.html">monero</a> when possible</li>
          <li>limit screen time, period</li>
        </ul>

        <aside>"'JuSt DeCeNtRaLiZe' you idiots will never get anywhere because this removes platforms"<br />

        <p>well, yes. that's (kind of) the point.</p>
        
        <p>we should be more focused on our direct, real-life communities. "platforms" can be helpful for generating a following, but they have algorithms that must be gamed, they do not provide almost any measure of internet privacy, and there are many instances of technology lowering one's chance of success rather than improving it (see: cancel culture, private moments being filmed and posted, etc).</p>
        <p>we can take back control of our information and online presence, though.</p>
