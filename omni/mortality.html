        <p>mortality awareness increases when your life trust must be placed in the general public. danger is everywhere in the surrounding area and one must always be alert.</p>
        <p>mores don't exist in the confines of a moving car - an issue for which there is no solution, yet one that i must deal with the consequences of nonetheless.</p>
