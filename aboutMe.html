      <p>my name is takoda, i am 25 years old and am destined for greatness.</p>
      <p>i currently live alone but plan to acquire a dog or snake sometime, a german shepherd or a california king snake, respectively.</p>
    <p>i am a high school graduate with some college credits, but school is expensive and my dream jobs are things where schooling isn't always required. as a result, my college attendance is on hold while i collect money to survive on.<br />
      my wages are earned via my acting as an inventory clerk at a growing, albeit niche, tech company. i intend to do life on my own terms, though, <a href="misc/bucketList.html">and hope to accomplish some great things.</a></p>
