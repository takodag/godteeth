        <p>my name is takoda, i am 25 years old and am destined for greatness.</p>
        <p>i currently live alone, but have a beautiful partner who supports me in everything i do.<br />
          i plan to acquire a dog or snake sometime, a german shepherd or a california king snake, respectively.</p>
        <p>i am a high school graduate with some college credits, but school is expensive and
          my dream jobs are things where schooling isn't always required.<br />
          as a result, my college attendance is on hold while i collect money to survive on.<br />
          my wages are earned via my acting as an inventory clerk at a growing, albeit niche, tech company.</p>
        <p>i intend to do life on my own terms, though, <a href="misc/bucketList.html">
          and hope to accomplish some great things.</a></p>
