        <p>this month has been less than kind.</p>
        <p>Pearl was a white german shepherd about waist-height, and the absolute sweetest dog I've ever met. she would listen and not act out and would never let you be sad. unfortunately, Pearl suffered a bout of cancer. it came the time to do that most difficult deed that must be done when a pet is no longer capable of leading a fulfilling life. it is still difficult to understand why this happened, and more difficult still to be in a quiet, empty home when my partner is out running errands. Pearl was the best dog anyone could ever ask for. she will be severely missed and will live forever in my partner and i's hearts.
