        <p>this is my first "blog" post, on my first website. feels pretty cool. i guess this one is more like a quick journal post though.</p>
        <p>i'm at taco bell right now (a recurring theme, you'll come to find out), on lunch break. i've ordered a box meal. today during lunch i'm listening to my 6,219 liked songs on shuffle, and it's giving me a pretty good selection.</p>
        <p>being as it is tuesday, tonight for dinner i'm going to my parents' house, but i'm unsure what i actually want. i think i may tell my mom i want burgers....</p>
        <p>anyway, check back on my site in the future for more content! i'm constantly updating this thing.</p>
