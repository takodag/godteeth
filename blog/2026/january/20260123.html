        <p>i have been hired! i begin work in mid-february as an administrative assistant (booking appointments, making collection calls, etc.). i have a good feeling about this; the opportunity came at just the right moment, and much of the work is what i gained experience with at my last job.</p>
        <p>i recently realized i own a kindle paperwhite, and so have been adding many classic books to it (and to my reading list). i also began a proper <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commonplace_book" target="_blank">commonplace book</a> in one of my <i><a href="../../../lists/edc">field notes</a></i> pocket notebooks. if there is any nonfiction you recommend (essays, treatises, journals, dialogues, articles, (auto)biographies, whatever you find truly worth reading), please e-mail or contact me on social media! i want to read more, write more, and generally become more well-rounded this year.</p>
        <p>other things i want to do this year include, but are not limited to, play shows as godteeth (the musician), reupholster my motorcycle's seat, learn to cook, be more active, read and write more, become conversational in spanish, take more photos and get better at doing so, explore scent, and to film something (a film, a music video, whatever).</p>
        <p>i'm working on a visual album/ep, it's six tracks long and i'm near the end of it all. i just have to finish the visual aspect for track six, then it will be ready for release. i've learned in creating this that i really would like a bigger/better computer setup. the macbook air is no longer cutting it - the screen is too small, and it's not powerful enough to run the programs i want to run efficiently, not to mention the fact it no longer receives upgrades and currently runs old versions of all the software i use (thus locking me out of some projects). it's a pain. i have another four-track ep ready to have visuals made as well, for which the idea i have should be easier, if more time-consuming, to make than my recent efforts.</p>
        <p>today i must go to the library. the weather is nice and clear, but it "feels like" -12 fahrenheit. wish me luck.</p>
