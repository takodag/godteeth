        <p>many adventures have been had since last i updated.</p>
        <p>in december, my partner and i took a week-long vacation to puerto rico. there was a lot to do, and much to see. we hiked in the jungle, down mountains and along rivers. the foliage was beautiful, and the sounds very peaceful. some trails were quite slippery and tight, but always worth it for the views or the swimming hole. twice we went scuba diving in the ocean and fell absolutely in love - when next we travel to a tropical location, i suspect the urge will be great and we will do so again. it was a pleasure being able to experience the culture of the island as well, which felt much more laid back and full of life than much of the mainland u.s.</p>
        <p>this year we went to two <a href="../../../lists/festivals.html">music festivals</a>: electric forest and secret dreams. electric forest was fantastic. the weather was perfect (if a little hot) and nearly every act we went to see was no less than great. secret dreams was a new experience, one that was both a good time and a hard time. it is held somewhere we had never been, and has fewer resources (which mostly shows when it comes to logistics - water, bathrooms, personnel), and we experienced severe storms which rained out several acts and ruined many peoples' camps, but the focus on production was amazing. tipper and papadosio performed, artists which i have been attempting to see for years, and all the artists there had visual accompaniment. if not for the rain i would give it quite good reviews for a cheap, smaller festival.</p>
        <p>i have put out some music both alone and with others this year, you can find it by searching for "godteeth" on your preferred service (or by clicking one of the links on the homepage of this site). the collaborations (with <a href="http://malisima.me" target="_blank">malísima</a>) may appear on a different profile on streaming services (godteeth with a capital g) but i assure you they are mine. another collaboration is set to come out on november 21, this time with <a href="https://oliversbedroommusic.bandcamp.com" target="_blank">oliver's bedroom music</a>. i currently am finishing up a (short) album, so stay tuned for that!</p>
        <p>i lost my job in september (august?) and have yet to find a new one. if you read this and have a job available please consider reaching out. i do not have a degree but am very able to learn new things, and have experience in html, google suite, microsoft suite basics, quickbooks, customer service, music production, video editing, digital art, and more.</p>
        <p>we are considering getting another dog - scarlett needs a friend, right? something around her size, perhaps an australian shepherd or a samoyed.</p>
        <p>this year has been pretty low-key aside from the aforementioned events, but we will see what 2026 brings. i turn 28 in 4 days.</p>
